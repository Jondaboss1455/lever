      Levers are tools that help increase force, allowing a person to lift heavier objects with less effort. 
      They consist of a rigid bar that pivots around a fixed point called the fulcrum. 
      By positioning the fulcrum closer to the object being lifted, less force is needed to move it. 
      This idea has been around for a long time; ancient Greeks, especially Archimedes around 250 BCE, 
      famously illustrated the power of levers by saying, "Give me a place to stand and I will move the earth." 
      Early levers included simple tools like seesaws and crowbars, used by ancient civilizations like the Egyptians 
      and Mesopotamians to handle heavy loads. The fundamental concept of levers has been crucial in various
      technologies and engineering advancements throughout history.
